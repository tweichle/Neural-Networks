### Neural Network Classification Application in Python Using Keras

This repository contains the prediction of images using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and Fashion-MNIST dataset of clothing articles.

**Goals**

- Using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and Fashion-MNIST dataset of clothing articles, summarize and examine images.
- Build and train a Neural Network Classification model to predict handwritten digit images.
- Build and train a Neural Network Classification model to predict clothing article images.
